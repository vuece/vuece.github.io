<h2 class="icon-title" id="add_g_account">Adding Account(optional)</h2>
<p id="vuecep">This step is optional. Usually, if you have an Android device with you, you probably have already set up your Android device with your Google Account. Vuece Music application automatically loads existing Google Account(s) from your device and displays them in a list, you can then pick one of them and click 'Sign in' to continue, but if you want to add a new account that does not exist in you device, click '<b>Add new account...</b>' then follow instructions below to add a new Google Accout to your Android device.</p>

<h3 class="icon-title">Step 4. <b>Connect to Vuece Hubs</b></h3>

<h2 class="icon-title">Browsing Music on Hubs</h2>

<h3 class="icon-title"><b>Hub List</b></h3>
<img src="img/user_manual/music/hub_list.png">
<p id="vuecep">A list of avaialbe Hubs will be displayed after successful login. If a Hub is logged in with the same Google Account as your current Vuece Music app, we call it <b>Home Hub</b> because that Hub belongs to you. As you can see, a Home Hub has a HOME icon in the Hub list.<br>

Vuece app automatically enters your Home Hub's <a href="#folder_list"><b>folder list</b></a> if your Home Hub is in the Hub list.</p>

<h3 class="icon-title" id="folder_list"><b>Folder List</b></h3>
<img src="img/user_manual/music/folder_list.png">
<p id="vuecep">The folder list shows you a list of folders currently shared by the Hub you have entered. Each entry in the list tells your the name of the folder, the number of songs in that folder (not in its sub folders) and the number of its sub folders. Select one of the folders and the <a href="#song_list"><b>song list</b></a> screen will be displayed.</p>

<h3 class="icon-title" id="song_list"><b>Song List</b></h3>
<img src="img/user_manual/music/song_list.png">
<p id="vuecep">The song list shows you a list of songs available in the folder you have just entered. Each entry in the list tells you the name of the song, the singer and the duraiont of that song. Select a song from the list and Vuece Music app will start playing that song for you.</p>

<h3 class="icon-title" id="play_song"><b>Play a song</b></h3>
<img src="img/user_manual/music/play_song.png">
<p id="vuecep">Hooray! You have just started playing you first song with Vuece Music. This is Vuese Music's major 'magic' screen because it seems like a normal music player's main screen but the actual data is streamed <b>on the fly</b> from Vuece Hub, meanwhile you still can perform normal music player's operations like Pause/Resume, Rewind/Forward, Changing play mode(Shuffle/Repeat), etc.</p>


<h2 class="icon-title">Application Navigation</h2>

If the folder name doesn't change, that means you have already reached the top level folder of curret Hub.</p>

<p id="vuecep">Another option to go back to upper level folder is when current screen is folder list screen or song list screen, you can select first entry of the list to go back to upper level folder.</p>
